# Opinion Miner

Opinion Miner was built as a project for Udacity's Front End Development Nanodegree. 

Opinion Miner uses MeaningCloud's Sentiment Analysis API to run natural language processing on external articles or blog posts. 

This project uses webpack and sass styling. It uses a node.js server, and .env to disguise the API details.

The webpage was built with HTML, CSS & JS.
